Groovy Koans is a set of Koans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) which utilized unit tests to teach the Groovy language, API and idioms. This version was forked from git://github.com/cjudd/groovy_koans.
Modifications were made to use this Project in a University Course (https://homepages.thm.de/~bhsw76/doku.php?id=momiks:ws1415_rupp_schwarz)
